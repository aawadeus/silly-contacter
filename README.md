A simple python script that populates "Contact Me" areas of websites. Provide your own text files for First Names, Last Names and Email addresses. Then, change the functions to match the text file names. Depending on what the name of the fields of the site you want to use the script on, change the string to match it. If it says "Your Name" instead of "Name", change it to be "Your Name", etc.
